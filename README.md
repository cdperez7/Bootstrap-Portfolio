# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio site made using Twitter Bootstrap for Northerstern's Fullstack Coding Bootcamp.

 It's based off the first homework assignment, only now it behaves better across device sizes. Created using the features of Twitter Bootstrap and contains links to other projects.
