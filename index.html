                <p>Connor Perez is a currently participating in Northwestern's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. He was
                    born and
                    raised in Chicago, and graduted from Tulane University with a major in Latin American Studies,
                    and
                    minors in Business and Spanish. After completing his major and minor requirements, Connor took
                    coding
                    classes for fun his senior year at Tulane (one of which was taught in Spanish), where he was
                    first
                    introduced to computer science.</p>

                <p>After graduating, Connor worked in the public health field, most notably for the organization
                    Partners In
                    Health in Boston. At Partners In Health, he worked in donor support and fundraising, while
                    taking on
                    additional responsibilities in Dev Ops, managing data and completing large data imports and
                    exports.
                    After moving back home, Connor worked on quantatative analysis research for clinical drug trials
                    before
                    deciding to change careers and join the Northwestern program.</p>

                <p>In his free time, Connor enjoys cooking, eating, travelling, attending Cubs games, and reading
                    fantasy or
                    science fiction novels. He is specifically interested in food chemistry as well. At any point in
                    time,
                    it is likely that there are vegetables and a home made beer fermenting in his dark kitchen
                    pantry.
                    Connor is also a lover of animals, and with his fiancé, owns 2 cats - Jacque'mo and Forrest.</p>
